# Vote For your Favourite Stories and Pictures

It's been a lot of fun putting the newsletter together since we relaunched it in March and you've all come through with some fabulous stories and pictures. It's lovely to put the call out for content every month and have people take the time to write and send pictures, so thank you to all of our story and gallery contributors and to our committee members for writing updates on safety, coaching, competitions, events and other important news.

Time to vote for your favourites of 2024! Merry Christmas, let's hope Santa brings some decent weather for 2025 and we'll see you for the next issue in January.
