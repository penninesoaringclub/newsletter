# Chairman's Chunterings

*Brian Stewart, Chairman*

The driest/warmest/sunniest summer ever, and what happens? It's always windy up here. At least that's how it's felt this year. Even the big Dunbar day was a bit too tasty for mere mortals like me, so when the forecasts all seemed to align a couple of Sundays ago, RASP painting the county red and wonder of wonders: LIGHT WINDS, what could possibly go wrong...?

As one of the more venerable of the Parlick old-timers, I should know full well that almost nil wind on the south face means a frustrating, hot, sweaty wait for the 1 o'clock thermal, a frantic dash to be in the air (and not in the way) when it arrives. The number of times I've been slogging back up after a case of premature aviation, or caught with my harness down when it arrived too early, only to watch the skygods specking out towards the clouds. Once or twice I've been up with the SGs, but my record's pretty poor.

So, knowing all this, why was I still on the ground when the bun fight started? Timing is everything in this game, and after they all lifted off, that was it for ages. Nothing for it but to hang around and hope there'd be another one along soon. But thermals aren't buses...

Tim set off to fly down on retrieve duty for Andrew, only to find he'd left his glider bag on top. Cue frantic radio messages and recruitment of civilians to aid in the hot and sticky search and carry the bag down to him. 

Of course the bag turned up.

In his harness.

Pints are owed...

Anyway I hung around long enough to be able to avoid retrieve duty, as most weren't too far scattered. Stupid sport...

# Competition Diary

*Doug Neil flies at the 2025 British Nationals in Monte Cucco*

My second trip to Italy in 2025, this time for the British Nationals at Monte Cucco. Conditions weren't great but we managed to fly five tasks during the week and for myself a mixed bag of results.

Task 1 and 2 were at the Sarnano takeoff - similar tasks on both days.  I misjudged the height I needed to hit turnpoint 1 on task 1 so missed out on a reasonable flight. Task 2 allowed me to have a second go at it, and I made it comfortably then flew to within 7km of turnpoint 2 before having to turn back to a decent landing field (3rd place on the day).

Tasks 3,4 and 5 were at the Monte Cucco North takeoff. Task 3 had a seemingly impossible (for sports class gliders) 12km first leg into wind; 3 pilots made it to the first turnpoint but were on the ground soon afterwards. I made it past minimum distance but landed out in the valley along with the rest of the field.

Task 4 and 5 started by going downwind over the back of Monte Cucco.  Task 4 was a great task for most people, but I bombed out after only 7km - making the same mistake I made trying to go XC from Longridge a few months ago; starting too low and hitting major sink (constant 6-8 down for at least 3 minutes) over the downhill side of the mountain, leaving me no height to search for a climb.

Task 5 gave me another shot at the downwind leg and I made sure I was high enough to avoid the sinking air. I ended up 5500ft above the field I landed in the previous day and managed to fly 33km, using several thermals, each taking me to 7-8000ft. Shortly after landing, the task was stopped due to approaching thunderstorms. This was a good day for me with 3rd place, after a couple other pilots were DQd for airspace infringement.

Task 5's good score meant I snuck into 3rd place in the British competition and 6th place overall. One more competition this year, the third part of the British Open Series in Wales in mid September.  I'm currently in 2nd place in this comp after winning task 1 earlier in the year.

# Top Tips

Three years ago, an experienced South Wales pilot popped up on [Paragliding Forum](https://www.paraglidingforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=p692018#p692018) asking for tips to help with the nerves that he'd started feeling in thermals and at altitude.

The thread has comments from all sorts of pilots, from an ex-British champion, to PSC punters and your newsletter editor.

He came back this week to say how much the thread had helped him and seeing as we all get the heebie-jeebies sometimes, it seemed a good idea to pull the ideas in that thread into a list of tips for combatting nerves, so here they are.

### Tips for nerves

**Battle through and get more exposure**

- Get even higher and do so often and the nerves will fade away.

- After about half an hour or so I somehow manage to disconnect from the ground and after that I'm normally fine.

**Change your perspective**

- A mantra that I think about: "It's not scary, it's exciting".

- It's often better if you can concentrate on where others are in a thermal; then your height will become relative to them rather than the ground.

- When you start to feel "OMG something is wrong I am too high/ it is too turbulent/it is too strong" start to think to something else: if you keep focusing on those thoughts you will only make those fears bigger and bigger until you can't handle it anymore. Look at something far away (the next cloud? The next ridge?) and let your body manage the situation while your mind focus on something else.

- I have found a screaming vario to be a big factor increasing anxiety [so customise the beeps]. Normal beep ranges and changes to +6 m/s are fine. Beyond that I don't need further info so let it continue beeping at that rate even if climbing more. It'll just sound nice and even with a calming effect... perfectly even circles. Obviously, the cutoff point can be set to whatever individual tolerances are preferred, but the calming effect of an evenly beeping vario I cannot understate.

- One thing that helps me when I get nervous, if there are quite a few other paragliders around, is to think to myself: "They're not all collapsing, are they? So why should mine collapse? I'm a reasonably competent pilot (which you clearly are) and I'm on a certified EN B wing." And if the others ARE all getting collapses - go and land smartish!

- Don't look down. Seriously, if you're like me then when you're stressed you might find your attention starts to focus onto your instruments and onto the area of ground immediately in front of your harness. It tenses you up, stops you flying properly and makes you look at the ground, thinking about how high you are all the time. Take a few deep breaths and force your gaze up and out to the horizon, everything feels better.

- If you are flying in an open harness, try to fly in a pod. I'm sure it makes you feel more secure.


**Jedi mind tricks**

- Talk to yourself. I know more than one pilot who does that. Say something like "Jimmy you can handle that. And if you do not like it just get out of the thermal you can always do it and come back the next day. But so far, you are doing fine."

- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) involves identifying the unhelpful thoughts ("cognitions") which are causing the anxiety, and then (when you are calm and relaxed and not in the problematic environment) devising different ones, which you then then very deliberately substitute for them when next in the situation (that's the "behavioural" bit). So what I did was to determine how and where I could safely land before I even took off, then if becoming fearful in the air say to myself out loud "look, you really are safer up here than if close to the ground, and when you do want to get down, you know exactly how you can easily achieve that".

- It's worth Googling 'Box Breathing', which is sets of inhalation and exhalation to counts of four and really works. I've heard that some in the military call it 'combat breathing' and it's taught as an effective fast relaxation technique before you act.

- Smile inside your helmet.

- Sing.

- I talk to my wing, I talk to the air, I talk to myself. And I imitate a TV cooking show presenter from the 80's who had a funny accent from the South of France to make all these comments. The result is rather ridiculous and somehow it relaxes me.

**Set goals**

- Give little goals to yourself, so you will focus on those goals instead of your inner fears. A little goal may be something like "Well I am now at 1800 meters and climbing. I want to ride this at least to 2000 meters and then if I do not like I will get out of it." -or- "I will keep riding this beast for at least 30 more seconds and then re-assess the situation". This is by far what helped me the most because the trick is to keep giving yourself more little goals: so at 2000 meters you give yourself the goal to reach 2200 meters and so on.

- Don't just rock up to the hill with a vague idea to fly. Look at the weather the day before, find a spot 26km downwind, and program a declared flight into your instrument. Do the whole thing, starting cylinder too. Do it by the rules (no additional cylinders, diameters 400m, points far enough apart that they're going to get the bonus if you make it). Then when you get to the hill, activate the route. You've then got: (1) an immediate goal to get into the start cylinder. Place this so that you're not in it when you launch, but have to fly 100m or so off the ridge to get to it and (2) once you've pinged the start cylinder, your instrument will start pointing at goal, 25km or more away, and counting down the distance. Your mission is now get high, stay high, go downwind. With that goal literally sitting there in your lap, you've got a nice distraction from any nervousness, and motivation to ignore it because only by ignoring it will you reach your target.

**Analyse that**

- After each flight, spend some time evaluating in retrospective what happened (which may be different from what you felt while flying). Was it really bad? Really scary? Maybe not, so dare a little bit more the next flight!

**Don't rush it**

- Give time to yourself to recover. Little by little you will get back what you had before. Remember, it is still inside of you.

- My solution was to step back , forget about distance , forget about pushing harder and just chill on the coastline with mates soaring. Socializing with like minded souls on launch and just enjoying the sport in its simplest form.
