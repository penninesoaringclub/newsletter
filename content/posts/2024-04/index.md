# Editorial

Here it is. Issue one. Simon Scott appealed for a newsletter editor at the AGM, I put my hand up and now, as the search starts for interesting things to write about, I think we can all agree that the lesson here is never to put your hand up at an AGM.

We should be able to rustle up enough stories for a monthly news bulletin, at least through the flying season when we're all out on the hills. We'll round up XC and safety news, check dates for your diary and say hi to any new members but your newsletter needs you. Had a great day out? Let's see some pictures. Smashed your personal best? Let's hear about it. This is the place to tell us all what you did and how much fun you had doing it, or if you've embarrassed yourself, for somebody else to send in the photos of your glider in the Parlick landing field tree.

You don't have to write loads, a couple of paragraphs and a photo or two is perfect. Send anything you'd like to see included to [editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk](mailto:editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk).

### Northern Challenge Series

The Northern Challenge Series is open again for 2024 and runs until 31st October. Fourteen fixed XC tasks and six hike and fly tasks based on PSC hills and our neighbouring clubs' sites, to take on whenever you like as fun or competition.

It's easy to download the [tasks](https://www.xcmap.net/index.php?c=Northern%20Challenge%20Trophy&y=2024) to your flight deck map, including challenges on Parlick, Pendle and Longridge so why not give it a try this season?

### XC League

Philip Wallbank leads the [Pennine XC League](https://xcleague.com/xc/leagues/view-15.html) with two 11km flights from Parlick. If you're chasing your first ever XC submission, it's worth a look at the flights on the Pennine league so far - a couple of extended legs from Parlick takeoff to the far end of Fairsnape and back can just about tip you over the magic 10km.

Three more pilots have logged flights but these distances are sure to be obliterated soon as we gear up for spring and XC season proper.

In the national league, Barry Sayer leads the way for Pennine, scoring 24.6 points so far with flights from Barkin and Whitestones.

Don't forget there are now two XC Leagues - the [original one](https://xcleague.com/xc/leagues/view-15.html) that we all know about and another, newer one that lives on [XContest](https://www.xcontest.org/united-kingdom/ranking-club:2688). The XContest one does a prize t-shirt for your first 100km flight but other than that the way the tables work is also a little bit different. XContest scores Pennine pilots flying anywhere in the UK and the original XC League scores its own Pennine league table as flights only from Pennine controlled sites. We'll keep an eye on both.

# Pennine Fest

### 24th - 26th May (bank holiday weekend)

![landing](fest-small.jpg)

This year Pennine Fest is the same weekend as the Chipping Steam Fair so it will be lively.
- Chipping Showground - PR3 2QF
- Camping all weekend on the show field. Electric hook ups. Toilets but not showers.

Dinner at the Sun Inn on Saturday evening, which will be the usual chilli meal with a veg or vegan option. Please contact either Tim or Jim via social media or email accounts@penninesoaringclub.org.uk. We need to know numbers so do get your order in early as it always sells out. The room we use can accommodate 32 total.

At the time of writing I don't have prices for camping or meal but its always been very reasonable and won't break the bank. I'll post it up on  Pennine Chat Telegram group when available.

# Your Newsletter Needs You

Appear in next month's newsletter! We need submissions for...

**A Grand Day Out**  
2-3 paragraphs describing a fun day. You're welcome to write more if you're feeling creative but a couple of paragraphs is plenty. Could be epic, could be daft, could be simply the first time you flew for six months. If you've had a good day and you took some pictures, send it in.

**Why Not Visit...**  
A quick guide to a site that you like, at home or abroad. Tell us where it is, what it's like to fly, any watch-outs and how to contact the locals. Attach a photo and email it over.

**The Gallery**  
Send in any recent(ish) shots with when and where they were taken. Spectacular, silly, from the ground or from the air, it doesn't matter. Let's see what you've been up to. Videos are very welcome too but pop them on YouTube or Vimeo and send a link for the newsletter.

**Shout Outs**  
First ever XC? Smashed a PB? Took part in a comp? Let us know and get a shout out in the newsletter. Nominate your mates if they won't do it themselves.

Send submissions on these or anything else you'd like to see featured to [editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk](mailto:editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk)
