## It's spring! Quick, somebody tell the weather.

Welcome to your new look Pennine Soaring Club newsletter! Simon Scott called for a newsletter editor at the AGM, I put my hand up and so here we are. Issue one. I think we can all agree the lesson here is never to speak up at an AGM.

I'm hoping that between us we can rustle up enough stories for a monthly news bulletin, at least through the flying season when we're all out on the hills. We'll round up XC and safety news, check dates for your diary and say hi to any new members but your newsletter needs you. Had a great day out? Let's see some pictures. Smashed your personal best? Let's hear about it. This is the place to tell us all what you did and how much fun you had doing it, or if you've embarrassed yourself, for somebody else to send in the photos of your glider in the Parlick landing field tree.

You don't have to write loads, a couple of paragraphs and a photo or two is perfect.

Neil C.

## Competitions

### Northern Challenge Series

The Northern Challenge Series is open again for 2024 and runs until 31st October. Fourteen fixed XC tasks and six hike and fly tasks based on PSC hills and our neighbouring clubs' sites, to take on whenever you like as fun or competition.

It's easy to download the [tasks](https://www.xcmap.net/index.php?c=Northern%20Challenge%20Trophy&y=2024) to your flight deck map, including challenges on Parlick, Pendle and Longridge so why not give it a try this season?
