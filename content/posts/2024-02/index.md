# Chairman’s Chunterings

Welcome to the PSC newsletter, grateful thanks to the efforts of our new committee member, Neil Charles for creating the first of what we hope will be many issues.

Well, the AGM came and went with a few surprises along the way. After several years doing an excellent job, Simon Scott stood down as chairman, and as I try to step into his shoes, I’d like to thank him on behalf of all the members for the great work he’s done in guiding the club and keeping us all together.

It’s not easy coordinating the activities of 200-odd (some very odd) free-spirited free-flyers and the current state of harmony and goodwill in the club is a testament to his efforts – thanks Simon, for giving me such a hard act to follow. Of course, he’s continuing to serve on the committee, taking over the role of secretary from Barry Sayer, who is moving across to be safety officer, relieving me of the onerous duty of trying out all the ways pilots can hurt themselves.

Sean Mercer is our new ~~sergeant-at-arms~~ membership secretary, inheriting this position from Jim Ashley, who will continue as chancellor of the exchequer. The inimitable Graham Jones makes a return to the committee as our new social secretary, and we welcome the very competitive Elliott Brown as competitions secretary, taking over from the equally competitive John Murphy, who has left the committee after an incredible 27 years of continuous service. John, thank you so much for the time and effort you have put into your various roles on the committee over the years – I think you must have done almost every job available within the club, and I’m sure we’ll often be back to you for the benefit of your experience. Now, all we need is a weather officer to improve the dreadful start to the year so far.

# Welcome Everyone

Here it is. Issue one. Simon Scott appealed for a newsletter editor at the AGM, I put my hand up and now, As the search starts for interesting things to write about, I think we can all agree that the lesson here is never to speak up at an AGM.

We should be able to rustle up enough stories for a monthly news bulletin, at least through the flying season when we're all out on the hills. We'll round up XC and safety news, check dates for your diary and say hi to any new members but your newsletter needs you. Had a great day out? Let's see some pictures. Smashed your personal best? Let's hear about it. This is the place to tell us all what you did and how much fun you had doing it, or if you've embarrassed yourself, for somebody else to send in the photos of your glider in the Parlick landing field tree.

You don't have to write loads, a couple of paragraphs and a photo or two is perfect. Send anything you'd like to see included to [editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk](mailto:editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk).

Neil.

# Competitions

### Northern Challenge Series

The Northern Challenge Series is open again for 2024 and runs until 31st October. Fourteen fixed XC tasks and six hike and fly tasks based on PSC hills and our neighbouring clubs' sites, to take on whenever you like as fun or competition.

It's easy to download the [tasks](https://www.xcmap.net/index.php?c=Northern%20Challenge%20Trophy&y=2024) to your flight deck map, including challenges on Parlick, Pendle and Longridge so why not give it a try this season?

### XC League

Did somebody say the weather's been bad? There are _no flights_ on the Pennine XC League yet for 2024 so if you log the first one, you could top the table.

Three Pennine pilots have logged flights on the national XC league already though, flying from Barkin and Lords. Scott O'Neil is the top Pennine pilot in the national league with 21.7 points and Barry Sayer and Elliot Brown have one 13km flight each.

Don't forget there are now two XC Leagues - the [original one](https://xcleague.com/xc/leagues/view-15.html) that we all know about and another, newer one that lives on [XContest](https://www.xcontest.org/united-kingdom/ranking-club:2688). The XContest one does a prize t-shirt for your first 100km flight but other than that the way the tables work is also a little bit different. XContest scores Pennine pilots flying anywhere in the UK and the original XC League scores its own Pennine league table as flights only from Pennine controlled sites. We'll keep an eye on both.

Somebody's had a good day somewhere. A few paragraphs with pics.

# Why Not Visit...

### Newgale

Why not visit... is a quick look at a flying site far enough away that you can't see it from Clitheroe. In the UK or abroad, tell us all about somewhere fun to go.

_Neil Charles writes_

{{< gallery match="newgale/*" sortOrder="desc" rowHeight="150" margins="5" thumbnailResizeOptions="600x600 q90 Lanczos" showExif=true previewType="blur" embedPreview=true >}}

_Where?_

Pembrokeshire, right out on the edge of West Wales.

_What's it like to fly?_

Newgale is a coastal launch, tucked into the northern end of St David's Bay. In a summer westerly it attracts a mix of a few locals and any visitors who have managed to sneak their wing into the car on a family holiday. The site itself is low airtime friendly, very pretty and has some interesting corners to explore. If you can get a few hundred above then the possibility opens up of crossing the bay at Nolton Haven to the South, joining the high cliffs at Druidstone and flying all the way down to Broad Haven. There and back will bag you a fun, technical, [10km coastal XC](https://flyxc.app/?p=euk%7BHdoe%5Ej%60I%7Bq%40g%60Ibu%40).

_Any watch-outs?_

- If the wind is off the hill, some of the undulating cliffs around takeoff can generate areas of rotor. The locations where this happens are obvious but don't get low and fly in behind a spur.

- Flying two hours either side of low tide.

- Crossing the bay at Nolton is a short glide but over deep water and can be intimidating. Don't commit if you're not sure.

_Who are the local club?_

Newgale isn't a club site but is looked after by the local school, [Pembrokeshire Paragliding](http://www.pembrokeshireparagliding.com).
