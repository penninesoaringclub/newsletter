# Snow and fog, it must be January

How's your 2025 planning coming along? With a bit of luck you've managed to get out on the snowy hills but even if not, we've got a packed issue of 2025 diary dates to help you plan your next adventure. Book a trip, try a competition or spend an evening setting up your instruments and tracking, it won't be long until the thermals are launching us skywards.

Some lucky Pennine pilots have had good days out over the winter at home and abroad so we've got the usual gallery full of pics to whet your appetite.

# Notes from the Committee

### Winter club nights

We've had some brilliant club nights over the winter including talks on weather forecasting, flying in India, epic XC tales and most recently microlight flying and BASE.

Many thanks to everyone who gave up their time to speak. You can catch up with videos and photos of all of the events on the [PSC Website](http://www.penninesoaringclub.org.uk/articles/).

# Sites

*Andy Archer, Sites Officer*

The gate code for Winter Hill has been changed as of Friday 10th Jan 25 @3pm.

Please contact a member of the committee for the new gate code (WhatsApp/text/Telegram/email/FB messenger)

Please follow the rules:

- Generally only the lower gate will be locked.
- If both gates are locked they will have the same code.
- The lock codes will be changed every 3 months or sooner if required.
- Do not allow anyone to tailgate you through the gate.
- Make sure the gate is locked shut behind you.  Do not leave unlocked, even if you know another member will be on their way in a few minutes.
- On securing the lock ensure you scramble the code, DO NOT leave it on the unlock code.
- PSC members must obtain the code from a member of the committee, DO NOT distribute it further.
- Report any suspicious behaviour to a member of the committee.

# Safety

*Barry Sayer, Safety Officer*

### Reserve repack day

A reserve repack day (your emergency parachute system) will take place on 9th March 2025 at Chipping Village Hall.
It's essential that your reserve works correctly should you need it. Learning how to inspect your parachute, fold it as-per manufacturers spec and then install it in your harness is relatively straightforward and very satisfying.

Previous repack days have always been successful with a nice relaxed atmosphere at Chipping village hall and excellent attendance from many of the PSC members.

# A Grand Day Out

*Doug Neil at the Canaries Open Hang Gliding Competion in Lanzarotte*

The bad weather in autumn 2024 convinced me into travelling to Lanzarote to fly in the Sport Class section of their annual Open competition at the beginning of December.  24 degrees for much of the week did a lot to banish the winter blues.  The comp was well run and very friendly - I was allocated a space in the French and Swiss retrieve bus who made me very welcome.

Weather conditions weren't fantastic - cloudbase on most days was around 2000-2250ft and wind mainly from the east so it was clear at the start that tasks on the famous Famara cliffs were out of the question.  In the end we managed 5 tasks out of 7 days though, so it was a very worthwhile trip.

The low cloudbase meant that over-the-back type tasks were not possible.  Instead each day we were given cats-cradle type tasks with many turnpoints (I think one day there was 14 turnpoints on the course).  There were about 50 pilots altogether in 3 different competitions (class 1 flex gliders, class 5 rigid gliders, and sports class kingposted gliders) which made the sky very busy at times.

I'm still pretty new to competitions and its clear from my results that I'm far from consistent.  On my best day I managed 3rd place, only a few hundred metres behind second.  However, on a couple of days I made some mistakes that cost me a lot of points.  In the end I managed 6th place, so just below mid-table in the sports class.  A lot of good lessons learned throughout the week, new friends made and great fun.

# 2025 Competitions

*Elliott Brown, Competitions Secretary*

Thought I’d put some info together for 2025, what’s coming up and where you can find info. (I’m biased towards paragliding and XC so I will miss things that are focused on Hike and Fly and accuracy, as well as hang gliding and others.)

One thing that will probably impact UK competition this year will be the guidance issued from the BHPA in regards to cross-country flying. A lot of the competitions, bar things like coaching alongside them, are probably going to end up being pilot rated or above.

XContest - 1st Oct 2024 - 30th Sep 2025

XCleague
Loop local flights will be calculated from these results.
