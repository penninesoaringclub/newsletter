- The Pennine Post
- The Parlick Press
- Wing Tips

## Safety

Obligatory spring thermal warning.

## Competitions

### Northern Challenge Series

The Northern Challenge Series is open again for 2024 and runs until 31st October. Fourteen fixed XC tasks and six hike and fly tasks, to take on whenever you like as fun or competition.

It's easy to download the [tasks](https://www.xcmap.net/index.php?c=Northern%20Challenge%20Trophy&y=2024) to your flight deck map, including challenges on Parlick, Pendle and Longridge so why not give it a try this season?
