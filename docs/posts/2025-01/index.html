<p>Winter&rsquo;s here and that means club nights. Pub grub, a beer and talking flying for a couple of hours, what could be better than that? Well flying could, obviously, and a few of us have managed some bumpy days and smoother evenings to scratch that itch.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for flyable windows and interesting club night talks and we&rsquo;ll be back with another issue in January.</p>
<p>Heated gloves for Christmas please Santa.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-know-what-to-do-right-now">Do You Know What To Do, Right Now?</h3>
<p>This article appeared in the DHPC newsletter recently and I&rsquo;m grateful to the author, Rob Uselmann, for letting me use it adapted slightly for our club.</p>
<p>Note from Rob: I first drafted this article a few days before the terrible news of Kev&rsquo;s passing on the hill and, being new in this role of co-opted first aid officer, considered pulling this version in lieu for a &lsquo;softer&rsquo; approach. I was however encouraged by the committee to keep it as is.</p>
<p>Imagine this:<br>
You are out flying with your mate and are having a grand time under beautiful skies. Suddenly, you realise you can&rsquo;t see their wing in the air and after some looking around you see them on the deck &hellip;wing out&hellip; not moving&hellip; no response on radio. SHIT SHIT SHIT. You are the only other person around.</p>
<p>Close your eyes, imagine this scenario: What do YOU do right now?! Be honest.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have no clue and &lsquo;freeze&rsquo;: I convince myself they&rsquo;ll be alright, probably just radio not functioning and taking a breather, and I continue flying (whilst secretly shitting myself).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no clue and panic: I fly over and drop down to land quickly. After I miraculously manage to land unharmed myself, I drop my gear, run over and rip their helmet and gear off to see how they&rsquo;re injured. Need to call 999. Shit my phone is still on my gear deck which has now blown into a tree. Once I recover it, shit no signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I recall a bit from reading, youtube, or a first aid course many years ago: I fly over and descend with my heart in my throat, landing a bit rough but ok. I quickly bundle my wing and throw my harness on it to secure it, grab my phone and run over. Something &ldquo;ABC&rdquo; but what exactly. My mate is breathing so I don&rsquo;t touch them. I secure his wing and run up hill to find a signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this: I take a deep breath and slow my heart rate. I fly over and descend within my capabilities (aided by the SIV course I did not long ago) and land a bit away from the emergency site. I quickly secure my own gear, pull out my phone, DHPC Emergency Card, compact First Aid kit and my tracker, and start applying &ldquo;DRC ABC&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s no phone signal so I activate my emergency satellite beacon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Are you #4? Please become my flying buddy!</p>
<p>For everybody else, how do you feel right now? Do you wish you knew better what to do?</p>
<p>Maybe you think this is not going to happen to you?</p>
<p>BHPA statistics 2020-23 show that every year there are 150-180 accidents outside a school setting, 100-120 resulting in injury, half of those serious. With 7000 members, that means roughly each year 1:100 sustain serious injury. DHPC (and PSC) has over 200 members.</p>
<p>As you might have seen or heard, the club is once again considering organising a (possibly subsidised) outdoor First Aid course. With existing committee members already loaded, they saw fit to introduce the new role of First Aid officer. I have a bit of background in emergency care and was already well aware how out of date I myself am getting, so this is a topic near my heart.</p>
<p>Considerations to the club are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current level of FA experience in the flying membership.</li>
<li>Level and duration of course required/desired: one v two days</li>
<li>Cost of course</li>
<li>Level of club sponsorship (if any)</li>
<li>Timing:</li>
<li>Location</li>
</ul>
<p>Course:
A comprehensive, remote-setting, substantially hands-on course is two days but provides a solid basis for all types of emergencies in a remote incident environment. The alternative would be a one-day course adapted from the standard ones to cover the sorts of situations we are likely to face. Based on their survey responses, DHPC have opted for a one-day course, tailored to free flight incidents.</p>
<p>There is a link below to a survey for PSC members to find out what YOU are looking for. Please take the trouble to follow the link and to answer the questions, even if you have no wish to do a course. That in itself is important feedback.</p>
<p>First Aid kits:
If you run into even a relatively minor accident and you don&rsquo;t carry even a very basic FA kit, you quickly have to tear up your clothes (or worse, wing) to make a bandage to stop bleeding or support a fracture. On the other end, all-encompassing first aid kit bags are wonderful, but also virtually useless during an accident if it sits in somebody&rsquo;s car at the bottom of the hill or even further away when on XC.</p>

<p>Our first club night of the year was dedicated to weather forecasting. Brian kicked us off with a deep dive into Rasp, followed by Andy, Simon and Neil on Met Office forecasts, aviation forecasts, XC Weather and wind at altitude.</p>
<p>Our webmaster Carl has helpfully listed links to all of the different web resources we talked about, together with the video on the <a href="http://www.penninesoaringclub.org.uk/articles/article-list/social-night-october-2024-weather-forecasting-to-fly/">PSC site</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve been flying for years there might well be some new bits in here that you haven&rsquo;t heard before.</p>

<h1 id="safety">Safety</h1>
<p><em>Barry Sayer, Safety Officer</em></p>
<p>Such bad weather has equated to no new incidents and accidents over the last few months and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing to write, although we could all favour more flyable days. The weather gods are providing very few opportunities to attack the hills and when a flying window has appeared the conditions have been quite spicy, with turbulent air, strong winds and big wind gradients to test all your pilot skills. Make good decisions and don&rsquo;t get caught out due to desperation to fly.</p>
<p>Our chairman&rsquo;s article in Skywings last month was fantastic, revisiting the crucial elements of &lsquo;sharing the sky&rsquo; with Bowland gliding club. Reading the site guide and familiarising yourself with the sailplanes&rsquo; landing circuit and flight patterns will not only secure our good club relationship, it will keep everyone safe.</p>
<h3 id="reserve-repack-day">Reserve repack day</h3>
<p>A reserve repack day (your emergency parachute system) will take place early March 2025. It is provisionally planned for Sunday 09/03/25 - confirmation will follow.
Pencil this in your diary! It&rsquo;s essential that your reserve works correctly should you need it. Learning how to inspect your parachute, fold it as-per manufacturers spec and then install it in your harness is relatively straightforward and very satisfying.</p>
<p>Previous repack days have always been successful with a nice relaxed atmosphere at Chipping village hall and excellent attendance from many of the PSC members.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that at some point during your paragliding or hang gliding adventures that you will end up in the white room. <a href="https://xcmag.com/news/paraglider-pilot-swept-to-7300m-in-himalayan-storm-and-survives/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=News&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawGPf-lleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHW84kYjjsM6-yhlx61GA8O2ZLuUiwm4wjrewQ9PXjAI05TKnEg6t64oUBg_aem_C992fK_2iqLYpGbKx6wKbA">Recent news reports</a> of a paraglider pilot being sucked into a cloud on a cross country flight in India saw him reach altitudes of over 7,000 metres, not of their choice. Incredible assent rates and rapid decent techniques not working must be a frightening experience most would like to avoid. The pilot survived fortunately.</p>
<p>Large clouds will suck you into them so being fully aware of the conditions and environment you are flying in is very important. It is vital that you have an early and safe escape route, using rapid decent methods as to keep a visual with other air traffic and in clear sight of the ground.
On occasions it&rsquo;s a great memorable experience whilst skimming clouds and flying through small ones. The danger lies with you having no visibility, no visual reference of the ground, and this can result in disorientation and even unnerving panic.</p>
<p>A personal experience of going in the white room this summer on  a beautiful thermic day at Windbank in Yorkshire. The five star day took many pilots up to a cloud base at 4,700 feet, and with a brief use of big ears to lose the required altitude it was a simple effective manoeuvre to resume back to normal flight conditions. Good communication and separation with my flying buddy, plus holding our heading, was the key factor to drop out of the climb. Collision avoidance is a priority in these situations, just imagine several pilots flying in a cloud making turns, it would inevitably cause a very dangerous scenario for mid air collision.</p>

<p>We had a great day playing in high winds on Longridge Tuesday 29th, flying a 15m Flare Line, here&rsquo;s a couple of videos. Nobody else flying, it was strong, bumpy and well off to the West. There was a guy there flying model planes and we had a good laugh with him as well, sharing the hill and keeping good relations.</p>

<p>Another wrap for the year (1st October). The leaderboard hasn’t changed a lot over the last couple of months, I was hoping for a last great flight before the darkness crept in.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to sign up for next year&rsquo;s season, I know a couple of flights have been going up already from club members.</p>

<p>Are there any challenges that you set yourself when flying a pennine site or you have a dream flight in your head?</p>
<p>I would like to put together a set of PSC challenges (alongside the grid challenge - <a href="http://www.xcmap.net/x.php?t=544&amp;c=Pennine">http://www.xcmap.net/x.php?t=544&amp;c=Pennine</a>) that we can all have a go at.
Might be things like the Totridge run. Maybe Pendle to Longridge and back or a fun triangle out from Edenfield. If you have any ideas or challenges you set yourself, please can you share them with me and I will see about getting them added to xcmap as challenges/tasks we can all enjoy.
I would like to include as many sites as possible, but realise a few might not have a lot of takers.</p>
<p>Telegram me direct or email <a href="mailto:competition@penninesoaringclub.org.uk">competition@penninesoaringclub.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Ero Zsolt has written a fascinating blog post on <a href="https://hyperpilot.substack.com/p/the-future-of-paragliding-harness?triedRedirect=true">The Future of Paragliding Harness Back Protectors</a>, trying to estimate the safety implications of the new generation of much thinner back protectors vs. older, thicker, foam ones.</p>
