      <description>Champagne Corks and Festivals May came and went with the weather providing more short flying windows, including gracing Pennine Fest with a morning&amp;rsquo;s flying on Parlick. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s grabbing bits and pieces of flying where they can so fingers crossed for better as we move into summer.&#xA;This one was looking like a short issue and then you lot suddenly came through with some fantastic contributions. A cynic might suspect the weather&amp;rsquo;s got you all bored and desperately looking for something to do!</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s that beeping sound? After a start to April that prompted the BBC to run a front page article titled &amp;ldquo;Why is it raining so much?&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;ve finally started to be rewarded with some flying weather. Saturday 20th April saw pilots high over Pendle and Longridge and since then it&amp;rsquo;s been, well, if not exactly epic then at least occasionally flyable.&#xA;The BBC asks the question on all of our minds.</description>

      <description>Quick, somebody tell the weather it&amp;rsquo;s spring Welcome to issue 2!&#xA;Last month&amp;rsquo;s votes have been counted and we&amp;rsquo;re now officially The Pennine Post so set your bookmarks to post.penninesoaringclub.org.uk and we&amp;rsquo;ll aim to be back on the first Tuesday of each month with news, events and pictures of all of the spectacular flying we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. Or pictures of parawaiting. Probably mostly parawaiting.&#xA;Thanks to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s sent contributions this month.</description>

      <description>Chairman’s Chunterings Welcome to the PSC newsletter, grateful thanks to the efforts of our new committee member, Neil Charles for creating the first of what we hope will be many issues.&#xA;Well, the AGM came and went with a few surprises along the way. After several years doing an excellent job, Simon Scott stood down as chairman, and as I try to step into his shoes, I’d like to thank him on behalf of all the members for the great work he’s done in guiding the club and keeping us all together.</description>
