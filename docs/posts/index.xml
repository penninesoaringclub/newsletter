      <description>Quick, somebody tell the weather it&amp;rsquo;s spring Welcome to issue 2!&#xA;Last month&amp;rsquo;s votes have been counted and we&amp;rsquo;re now officially the Pennine Post so set your bookmarks to post.penninesoaringclub.org.uk and we&amp;rsquo;ll aim to be back on the first Tuesday of each month with news, events and pictures of all of the spectacular flying we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing. Or pictures of parawaiting. Probably mostly parawaiting.&#xA;Thanks to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s sent contributions this month.</description>

      <description>Chairman’s Chunterings Welcome to the PSC newsletter, grateful thanks to the efforts of our new committee member, Neil Charles for creating the first of what we hope will be many issues.&#xA;Well, the AGM came and went with a few surprises along the way. After several years doing an excellent job, Simon Scott stood down as chairman, and as I try to step into his shoes, I’d like to thank him on behalf of all the members for the great work he’s done in guiding the club and keeping us all together.</description>
