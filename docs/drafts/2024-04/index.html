<p>Welcome to issue 2!</p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s votes have been counted and we&rsquo;re now officially the Pennine Post so set your bookmarks to <a href="https://post.penninesoaringclub.org.uk/">post.penninesoaringclub.org.uk</a> and we&rsquo;ll aim to be back on the first Tuesday of each month with news, events and pictures of all of the spectacular flying we&rsquo;ve been doing. Or pictures of parawaiting. Probably mostly parawaiting.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who&rsquo;s sent contributions this month. The Pennine Post is <em>your</em> newsletter so if you want a good read to take your mind off work then you need to send something in.<br>
Email anytime to <a href="mailto:editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk">editor@penninesoaringclub.org.uk</a> or we also have a handy <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3NJQKlmLjjlh-nZGQKaeXzN6dSSL2PHzKRXFYAy_Bw7SC9w/viewform?usp=sf_link">web form</a> that you can use to ping over pictures and stories. If you&rsquo;re on a hill, take a photo!</p>
<p>This month we&rsquo;ve got wise words from our safety officer before the sun finally starts cooking up some spicy spring thermals, a new members shout out, rumours of some proper flying in the Lake District and loads of photos for you to look at wistfully while the rain comes down.</p>
<p>Hang in there. You&rsquo;ll be getting yanked skywards by your risers before you know it.</p>

<h3 id="inclusivity--who-needs-it">Inclusivity – who needs it?</h3>
<p>Another month, another period of rain, wind and non-flyable rubbish weather. One consequence of this is that more of us will be rustier than ever when the sun finally makes enough of an appearance, and I know our safety officer will be all over this with advice on staying the right way up.</p>
<p>Because we all need some support at some time in our flying: whether that’s specific coaching on how to eke out that extra 0.1 on the final glide, overcoming the butterflies in the stomach while setting up or just coping with the FOFU* on take-off. No man or woman is designed to be island, but this sport we love leads us into doing things alone, apart from the bits happening on the ground. We see so many people come and go in paragliding and hang gliding and maybe we don’t do enough to support them, or we fail to notice the signs – hanging back on perfectly launchable days, landing early, not turning out in good conditions, remaining isolated in the take-off area. It’s hard work getting to first base in UK free flying, with our fickle weather, so it’s a shame when people drift away for no reason other than feeling that their problems are unique to them, or that there’s no-one to help them.</p>
<p>I know our chief coach has some great ideas on how to promote a coaching system at all levels to nurture the embryonic newcomers, as well as the grizzled veterans, but we all have a part to play: next time on the hill, look out for those who might welcome a friendly word or just being included in the parawaiting chatter and pub debrief – you might just help someone persevere in this great sport. ‘Inclusivity’ is a modern buzzword that has become tainted by over-use and abuse. I take it to mean that we do our best to support and encourage anyone trying to progress in free flight.</p>

<p>* fear of f***ing up, a condition that gets worse with time and is calculated by the formula:<br>
FOFU index = (number of years you’ve been doing this) x (number of observers) x (number of years the observers have been doing this). [1]</p>
<p>A FOFU score greater than 25 can lead to palpitations on launch.<br>
A 4-digit score often leads to something worth recording and posting on YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="club-history">Club history</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been around for a while and in particular from the start of Pennine Soaring Club in 1993 and have any info or records from the past, we&rsquo;d be interested to hear from you. There are some gaps from pre 2002, which we would like to fill. Information such as committee positions, AGM reports, magazines&hellip; In addition, anything from earlier times too from the Pennine Hang Gliding Club days is welcome. It would be nice to have a more complete record of our history and could even prove useful at some point. Please get in touch in any of the usual ways.</p>

<p><em>BPMRT writes&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Hi there Jim,</p>
<p>On behalf of the Team, may I thank the Pennine Soaring Club, once
again for the most generous donation of £500.  We are entirely funded
by voluntary donations, and sums such as this really help us to be
ready to move quickly to whatever we are called to in Lancashire.</p>
<p>So far, this year, we have been called across the county to fallen
walkers and mountain bikers with various injuries, people who have
been lost, and bizarrely, a gent who seems to have just disappeared
off the face of the earth. Ages have ranged from 3 to quite senior.</p>
<p>Thank you once again. It really does help us make a difference.</p>

<p>Keep an eye out on our Telegram groups for the start of lambing restrictions. Edenfield will be out of bounds for a month - usually from 25th April - and if you&rsquo;re travelling to our neighbouring clubs, do check their websites. Sites may be closed and landing fields may be different ones to usual.</p>

<p><em>Nigel Bailey writes&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Passed my CP with Dean Crosby in November last year, went out and bought all the sparkling shiny new gear from Flybubble, and now just walk past it in the house, wondering if it will ever get used. As each day passes, and no flying or ground handing is happening, I seem to lose that little bit of hope and confidence that my feet will ever leave the floor voluntarily ever again&hellip; I have surely forgotten everything Dean taught me.</p>
<p>I did venture out to Algondanales Spain in December straight after qualifying, only to be dragged around my backside each day, whilst all around me flew like birds.
Ok, apart from a very short flight - see video - (so Proud of myself 🙂)
I was advised that this was normal for a new CP. I did even consider placing all of my gear straight on to ebay as soon as I returned. Pleased now I talked myself out of it.</p>
<p>So, April is around the corner, WhatsApp and Telegram seem to be coming alive with regular updates, so I am now just plucking up the courage to join you on the hills (if only to be dragged around them again on my already bruised backside).</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting up with you soon, and hopefully some very patient, sympathetic, tolerant and uncomplaining coach can refocus this &lsquo;wannabe&rsquo; Paraglider in 2024.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Scott O&rsquo;Neil for chalking up 57km - <a href="https://xcleague.com/xc/flights/2024667.html?vx=0">the longest flight of the day</a> - from Clough Head on Sunday 24th March - the same day that&rsquo;s given us all of our spectacular photos this month.</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s much to modest to have nominated himself for the shout out but he did take a cracking video of the day.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;A major software update to Flarm, the collision-avoidance system, has resulted in the disruption of the Open Glider Network live-tracking service and led to two XC Tracer instruments losing their Flarm functionality.</em>
<em>The two instruments that have lost their Flarm functionality are the XC Tracer Maxx II and XC Tracer Mini V. No other free-flight Flarm-enabled instruments are known to be affected.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>If you own an XC Tracer Maxx 2 or Mini 5, check the XC Tracer <a href="https://www.xctracer.com/en">website</a> for updated firmware. Even if you don&rsquo;t have one of those two instruments, it&rsquo;s worth checking your Flarm signal now and again to check you&rsquo;re actually broadcasting and that nothing on your flight deck is blocking the signal. After you&rsquo;ve been out flying for a day or two, check that you&rsquo;ve been picked up by OGN on the <a href="https://ktrax.kisstech.ch/flarm-liverange/">Ktrax website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A Grand Day Out</strong><br>
2-3 paragraphs describing a fun day. You&rsquo;re welcome to write more if you&rsquo;re feeling creative but a couple of paragraphs is plenty.

<p><strong>Why Not Visit&hellip;</strong><br>
A quick guide to a site that you like, at home or abroad. Tell us where it is, what it&rsquo;s like to fly, any watch-outs and how to contact the locals. Attach a photo and email it over.</p>
<p><strong>The Gallery</strong><br>
Send in any recent(ish) shots with when and where they were taken. Spectacular, silly, from the ground or from the air, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;ve been up to. Videos are very welcome too but pop them on YouTube or Vimeo and send a link for the newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>Shout Outs</strong><br>
First ever XC? Smashed a PB? Took part in a comp? Let us know and get a shout out in the newsletter. Nominate your mates if they won&rsquo;t do it themselves.</p>
