<p>Did you catch Big Tuesday? For those not in the office and with the skills to take advantage, Tuesday 29th April saw booming conditions, with flights from the Pennines all the way to Newcastle and Durham. Eight XContest pilots broke the 100km barrier from Parlick and those of us in the office at least got to watch along on <a href="https://puretrack.io/">puretrack.io</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some lovely contibutions this month from Scott, Doug and Elliott, plus important news about lambing on Edenfield and an update on Pennine Fest. Dust your tent off, it&rsquo;s going to be brilliant.</p>

<h3 id="edenfield">Edenfield</h3>
<p>Last month, I reported that after discussions with the farmer grazing sheep and lambs on the landing field, we had managed to keep the site open with an extended restriction period. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, following southerly winds, several members were approached by a different farmer while flying on the fell. Further discussions have since taken place with both farmers, and a new agreement has been reached.</p>
<p>Revised Arrangements:</p>
<p><strong>Edenfield landing field will be closed for lambing from 1st April to 25th May.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Edenfield site will return to the usual closure period of 25th April to 25th May.</strong></p>
<p>Please respect these closure dates.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p>

<p>From May to October, please do not land in the grass field next to Fell Foot cottage, east of the official landing field on the other side of the road. Fencing has been removed so it looks like a convenient option but during the summer the grass is being grown as a crop.</p>

<p><em>Doug Neil</em></p>
<p>The weather finally came good at the end of April, start of May and I managed to fly on 4 days out of 6. This helped me power through the 200th flying hour in my logbook, got me a smashed nose and beat my previous best distance in the UK.  Here&rsquo;s how my week went.</p>
<p><strong>Monday - Stanage, Peak District</strong></p>
<p>A good forecast and while I was rigging a couple of HGs took off and immediately caught thermals along the ridge and reached well over 3000 ASL. The wind then dropped and when I took off, it was a scratchy ridge run where I didn&rsquo;t get much over the top of the crags then ended up at the bottom. Great to see a decent size group of HGs in one place which is a rarity these days.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday - Tailbridge, Yorkshire Dales</strong></p>
<p>It was a perfect Tailbridge HG forecast and when I arrived it was 18mph and a great wind direction. Managed about an hour in air that began smooth but turned quite rough. Very choppy on landing and the glider spun on the ground with me ending up faceplanting in the dry grass and heather. My wife suspected a broken nose, but after the bruising faded a few days later it turned out to be just soft tissue getting mashed.  Try not to say &ldquo;Oooo, nasty&rdquo; at 2.42 in the video!</p>

<p><strong>Thursday - Bradwell, Peak District</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago I was selected as second reserve for the British team at the HG Class 1 Sports World Championships - a great opportunity to fly in a CAT 1 comp without any pressure to perform well; I could go along and just do my own thing! Recently, the first reserve pulled out and this week the comp organisers changed the rules so a team is 4 pilots instead of 3 and I became an official team member. After a couple of days of me flapping my hands and running around in circles screaming, I decided to up my game and joined another team member at Bradwell on an epic day that saw plenty PGs and my colleague flying all the way to the coast. Not so far for me but I landed after about 19km on the outskirts of Sheffield; my longest flight in the UK.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t so easy getting away from Bradwell with the sky teeming with PGs and a few HGs, all desperate for that first thermal. Eventually I picked one up however and stuck with it to 3000ft ASL and drifted about 3km. A short while after I caught another which took me to 5600ft ASL and another 4km. From this point I glided all the way to the outskirts of Sheffield at about 2300ft - not enough to get all the way across the city, I circled in zeros for a while then set off around the edge of the built-up area. It turns out that the sky over Sheffield was booming, so if I had ventured even a short way into the city I would have skyed out again and got much further, while still being able to turn around and escape to good landing fields if nothing turned up. A big mistake that I learned from that day. My path outside the border of Sheffield was non-stop sink and shortly afterwards I landed in a very large ideal field, sloping upwards into wind. A local resident turned up with ice lollies and a request for me to take off and land again because she didn&rsquo;t get her camera out in time!</p>

<p><strong>Saturday - Longridge</strong></p>
<p>RASP indicated a blob of red (5-star) joining Longridge to my home in Blackrod at around 2-3pm, so I headed out with a plan to fly about 30km. Wind was 15-20mph when I arrived, but by the time I had rigged it had dropped significantly so I was concerned about not staying up at all. I took off and carefully scratched along the ridge until I was about 100ft above the trig point - safe enough to zip up my harness. A few minutes later I picked up an excellent, smooth thermal that took me to cloudbase at 3600ft ASL. Listening on the radio to the PGs who were flying down on the ridge, it seemed that things were turning off so I turned downwind to follow my plan. This was a mistake, downwind was all in shade but out front of Longridge was sunny. I should have cancelled my plan and made the most of exploring the valley. Instead my flight downwind was a sled ride to the ground a few kilometres past Ribchester. I found another great landing field, though messed up my landing slightly with a late flare.  While derigging just after 2pm the sky opened up above me and looked far better - heyho, another lesson learned.</p>

<p>Lots of new pilots and flights were added in April. Whernside has had a good couple of days of flying, with lots of people attempting the task, with Mr Kay completing it. I tried my hand at Nappa (great site!), while I was in the Dales for the BP Cup and the weather wasn’t looking great for a task. Perfect day for the NCS tasks though!</p>

<p>Lots of activity on the XContest ranking this month, with a couple more pilots joining in the fun. Cracking flights for Scott in Scotland, has secured the top spot with a healthy lead. Parlick has had a number of good XC days in April, bumping those XC km’s for our pilots.</p>

<p>The Dales hosted 40 pilots from all over the UK to take part in the BP Cup UK round. We managed to get 2 good tasks completed.</p>
<p>Task 1 - TO Whernside - Goal - near Windermere 33.5km</p>
<p>Good conditions that changed into lots of top cover.</p>
<p>Task 2 - TO Barkin - Goal - Shap - 31.9km</p>
<p>Day 3 was written off, as there were lots of low clouds and an awkward wind direction. So free fly, bike or potter about day. Prize giving was done that afternoon and 2 of our club members placed in the top 6!</p>
<p>2nd - Paul ‘I’m not competitive’ Winterbottom
5th - Scott O’Neil</p>
<p>John Murphy and myself also joined in the good fun.</p>
