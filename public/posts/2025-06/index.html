<p>Hopefully everyone was too distracted by the X-Alps to notice June&rsquo;s newsletter went astray in the post. After some booming spring conditions, flying weather was a bit harder to come by and so were any photos or stories of you lot enjoying yourselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Pennine Fest went the same way too and had to be cancelled with absolutely no chance of any flying across the whole weekend.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re back! Paragliding and hang gliding have happened in the Pennines and we&rsquo;ve got photos and stories to brighten your day. Thoughts from Brian on the X-Alps, comps news from Elliot and our own Doug Neill on his escapades in the British Hang Gliding Team at Laveno-Mombello. Plus loads of photos</p>

<p>Risk &amp; Reward</p>
<p>X-Alps! What an amazing spectacle as the leaders homed in on Zell Am Zee; Aaron Durogati taking a risky direct route through the complexities of Innsbruck airspace after hiking through the night to grab 1st place by minutes. A great achievement after trying so hard in the previous events and great to see a new face, Lars Meerstetter who was Chrigel’s supporter and protégé, squeaking in ahead of Simon Oberrauner. So close after nearly 8 days of hard racing where the lead was constantly changing.</p>
<p>So fortunate that there were no major injuries despite the horror story videos of some of the take offs in the violent winds – the glider control skills on display were amazing, but not for the faint hearted, and when you see top pilots like Maxime Pinot withdrawing it does make you wonder when the risks get too much. I suppose it’s not unlike the Isle of Man TT which has a much higher injury record, and a heavy toll of fatalities too. No-one is compelled to enter either event, but there are of course pressures from sponsors, media and the desire for success. Chapeau to all those brave souls who take part, and those with the courage to say “enough”, recognising when things have moved beyond their comfort zones.</p>
<p>We’ve had our own epic days here this season – who can forget the pack flying from Parlick for over 7 hours to reach Dunbar, on a goal flight! I was happy to watch them go, having made the decision that the day would be too much for me, and I suspect there were some who flew that were less than happy about their choice. Our sport is one of the most thrilling things you can do with your clothes on, but as I draw towards the twilight of my flying career I feel so grateful for all the experiences I’ve shared with friends here and abroad without lighting up the scoreboards, just keeping in sight the reason we fly, which is for pleasure. The best pilots are those having the most fun.</p>
<p>Tight lines,</p>

<p>From May to October, please do not land in the grass field next to Fell Foot cottage, east of the official landing field on the other side of the road. Fencing has been removed so it looks like a convenient option but during the summer the grass is being grown as a crop.</p>

<h3 id="another-note-from-north-west-air-ambulance">Another note from North West Air Ambulance</h3>
<p>Hi, Jim.</p>
<p>I was away &rsquo;till late last week, so sorry if this is coming late to you&hellip;</p>
<p>Can I thank Pennine Soaring Club for your most generous donation. It is heartening to see that North west Air Ambulance is also supported so well by the club as many of our rescues (particularly those around Parlick) also involve them in getting a casualty to hospital quickly.</p>
<p>We have recently had to restock the splints that we carry for &lsquo;front line&rsquo; response, so the donation has come in very handy and is much appreciated. Our Parlick activity often has us having to delve into the splint packs!</p>
<p>We have responded to over 30 call-outs already this year, so 2025 looks to being as busy for our volunteers as any year.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, again, and the whole team joins with me in hoping you all stay safe up there and have only happy landings.</p>

<h3 id="pennine-fest">Pennine Fest</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the weather forcast for Pennine Fest promised absolutely no flying at all and so with very few people committing to come along, the committee took the decision to cancel.</p>
<p>There have been some early discussions of trying for a more flexible club event to try to work around the fickle weather - watch this space.</p>
